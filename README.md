# Title: Car Color Detector with CNNs in TensorFlow_
This project aims to develop an automated car color recognition system using a comprehensive dataset of various colored vehicles.

## Description:
Build a system to 💻 automatically recognize 🎨 car colors 🚙 using 📊 large dataset, TensorFlow's powerful CNNs. First, ✨ preprocess ✨ images using OpenCV, getting ready for in-depth analysis. This 🔝 efficient 🔝 system speeds up color ID processes for 🏢 various industries, e.g. vehicle mgmt, repair ops, or salvage appraisals.

## 👉 Technologies & Tools:

* 🐍 Python
* 🧠 TensorFlow
* 👀 OpenCV
* 🖥️ Linux
* 📚 Jupyter Notebook
